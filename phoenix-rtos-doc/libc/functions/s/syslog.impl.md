###Synopsis
`#include <syslog.h>`

`void closelog(void);`
`void openlog(const char *ident, int logopt, int facility);`
`int setlogmask(int maskpri);`
`void syslog(int priority, const char *message, ... /* arguments */);`

###Description
All these functions operate on the log file.
The `syslog()` function sends a message to the logging facility (`/dev/log`).
The `openlog()` function sets process attributes that affect subsequent calls to syslog(). 
The `setlogmask()` function sets the log priority mask for the current process to <u>maskpri</u> and returns the previous mask.
The `closelog()` function closes any open file descriptors allocated by previous calls to `openlog()` or `syslog()`.

Arguments:
<u>ident</u> - a string that is written to all logs identifying the function or the situation, which generated the current log.
<u>logopt</u> - logging options,
<u>facility</u> - a logging facility,
<u>maskpri</u> -  a log priority mask,

<u>priority</u> - a priority of the log,
<u>message</u> - a message to be put to the log.

The `syslog()` function sends a message to the logging facility (`/dev/log`). The logged message includes a message header and a message body. The message header contains a timestamp and a tag string. If logging device is not available, `syslog()` function puts the message to `stderr`.
The message body is generated from the message and arguments in the same manner as if these were arguments to `printf()`, except that the additional conversion specification `%m` is recognized; it converts no arguments, causes the output of the error message string associated with the value of `errno` on entry to `syslog()`, and may be mixed with argument specifications of the "%n$" form. If a complete conversion specification with the `m` conversion specifier character is not just `%m`, the behaviour is undefined. A trailing `<newline>` is also added.

As a severity level one of the following values is used:

`LOG_EMERG`     A panic condition.
`LOG_ALERT`     A condition that should be corrected immediately, such as a corrupted system database.
`LOG_CRIT`      Critical conditions, such as hard device errors.
`LOG_ERR`       Errors.
`LOG_WARNING`   Warning messages.
`LOG_NOTICE`    Conditions that are not error conditions, but that may require special handling.
`LOG_INFO`      Informational messages.
`LOG_DEBUG`     Messages that contain information normally of use only when debugging a program. 

Values of the priority argument are formed by OR'ing together a severity-level value and an optional facility value. If no facility value is specified, the current default facility value is used.

The facility indicates the application or system component generating the message. Possible facility values include:

`LOG_USER`      Messages generated by arbitrary processes. This is the default facility identifier if none is specified.
`LOG_LOCAL0`    Reserved for local use.
`LOG_LOCAL1`    Reserved for local use.
`LOG_LOCAL2`    Reserved for local use.
`LOG_LOCAL3`    Reserved for local use. 
`LOG_LOCAL4`    Reserved for local use.
`LOG_LOCAL5`    Reserved for local use.
`LOG_LOCAL6`    Reserved for local use.
`LOG_LOCAL7`    Reserved for local use. 

The `openlog()` function sets process attributes that affect subsequent calls to `syslog()` that is among others the path to the log file and a default facility. 

The <u>logopt</u> argument indicates logging options. Values for <u>logopt</u> are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of zero or more of the following:

`LOG_PID`       Log the process ID with each message. This is useful for identifying specific processes.
`LOG_CONS`      Write messages to the system console if they cannot be sent to the logging facility. The `syslog()` function ensures that the process does not acquire the console as a controlling terminal in the process of writing the message.
`LOG_NDELAY`    Open the connection to the logging facility immediately. Normally the open is delayed until the first message is logged. This is useful for programs that need to manage the order in which file descriptors are allocated.
`LOG_ODELAY`    Delay open until `syslog()` is called.
`LOG_NOWAIT`    Do not wait for child processes that may have been created during the course of logging the message. This option should be used by processes that enable notification of child termination using `SIGCHLD`, since `syslog()` may otherwise block waiting for a child whose exit status has already been collected. 

The `closelog()` function closes any open file descriptors allocated by previous calls to `openlog()` or `syslog()`.

The `setlogmask()` function sets the log priority mask for the current process to <u>maskpri</u> and returns the previous mask. If the <u>maskpri</u> argument is `0`, the current log mask is not modified. Calls by the current process to `syslog()` with a priority not set in <u>maskpri</u> are rejected. The default log mask allows all priorities to be logged. A call to `openlog()` is not required prior to calling `setlogmask()`.

Symbolic constants for use as values of the <u>logopt</u>, <u>facility</u>, <u>priority</u>, and <u>maskpri</u> arguments are defined in the <`syslog.h`> header.

###Return value

The `closelog()`, `openlog()`, and `syslog()` functions do not return a value.
The `setlogmask()` function returns the previous log priority mask. 

###Errors

No errors are defined.
